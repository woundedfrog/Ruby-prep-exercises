#Exception handling is a piece of code that handles errors, if they occur.
#  If an erorr occurs, then the specified 'exception handling' rules will allow the program to signal that an error occured, but still continue executing the remaining code.
#      
#    Without an exception handling rule stated, the program will stop executing.
